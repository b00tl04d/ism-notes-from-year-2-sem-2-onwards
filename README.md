## Infocomm Security Management (AY 2022), now the course is known as "Cyber Security and Digital Forensics" (CDF) with a different course structure  

<br>

## For the 5 remaining core modules in the course (that I am studying for)  

<br>

### DFI (Digital Forensics and Investigation)

<br>

### SC (Secure Coding) (Might also not take notes for this)
