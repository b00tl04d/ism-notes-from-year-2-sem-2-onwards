## How do cell phones work?  

Mode of communication:-  
• Full-Duplex  
– Operates on two channels  
– Speak and listen at the same time  
– Cell Phones – A cell phone is essentially a 2 way radio, consisting of a radio transmitter and a radio receiver. When chatting, phone converts voice into an electrical signal then transmitted via radio waves to the nearest cell tower  

• Half-Duplex  
– CB Radios (citizen band)  
• Radio frequency signal <-- > electrical signal  
– Only one party can speak at a time  
– Walkie-Talkie  

• Uses radio waves to talk to a cell tower that connects it to the rest of the phone network

## Cellular Layout  

• A mobile phone network that is composed of “cell” or signal area. These cells join or overlap each other to form a large coverage area. Users on the network can cross into different cells without loosing connection.  

• Phone network allows for “Frequency Reuse”. Cell 1s is on the same frequency, but the different 1’s won’t interfere with each other because of physical separation. The interference is called “cross talk” where you can hear other people’s conversations.
