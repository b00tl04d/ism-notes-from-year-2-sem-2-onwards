## Taking a Systematic Approach  

Steps for problem solving  
1. Make an initial assessment about the type of case you are investigating - <b>i.e interview people, decide on places to visit and ...etc</b>  
2. Determine a preliminary design or approach to the case. <b>i.e when to visit company employees</b>  
3. Create a detailed checklist. <b>Checklist helps you to stay on track</b>  
4. Determine the resources you need. <b>i.e. s/w n h/w</b>  
5. Obtain and copy an evidence drive  
6. Identify the risks. <b>i.e unable to access computer due to change of password</b>  
7. Mitigate or minimize the risks <b>to ensure original evidence is always available</b>
8. Test the design <b>like comparing the hash value</b>  
9. <b>Analyse and recover the digital evidence</b>  
10. <b>Investigate the data you recover</b>  
11. <b>Complete the case report</b>  
12. Critique the case <b>Self-evaluation to improve</b>  

<br>


## Assessing the Case  

Systematically <b>outline</b> the <b>case details</b> includes:
1. Situation: i.e. <b>employee abuse case</b>  
2. Nature of the case: <b>use email for personal matter</b>  
3. Specifics of the case: <b> detailed information of case</b>  
4. Type of evidence: <b> USB drive</b>
5. Known disk format: <b>FAT</b>
6. Location of evidence: <b>USB recovered from employee's desk</b>  

<br>

Based on these details, the case requirements can be determined  

<br>


## Planning Your investigation  

A basic <b>investigation plan</b> should include the following activities:  
1. Acquire the evidence  
2. Complete an evidence form and establish a <b>chain of custody (helps show where the file came from, who created it, and the type of equipment that was used)</b>  
3. Transport the evidence to a computer forensics lab  
4. Secure evidence in an <b>approved secure container</b>  
5. Prepare your <b>forensics workstation</b>
6. Retrieve the evidence from the secure container <b>(5. To ensure info is confidential. Container should be locked, fireproof locker or cabinet that has limited access)</b>  
7. Make a <b>forensic copy of the evidence</b>  
8. Return the evidence to the secure container  
9. Process the copied evidence with computer forensic tools (i.e Encase)  

<br>

An <b>evidence custody form</b> helps you document what has been done with the original evidence and its forensics copies  
* Also called a <b>chain-of-evidence form</b>  

<br>

2 Types  
* Single-evidence form, lists each piece of evidence on a separate page  
* Multi-evidence form  

<br>

Examples:
* <b>Model number or serial number</b> - List the model number or serial number (if available) of the computer component  
* <b>Evidence recovered</b> by - the name of the investigator who recovered the evidence. The chain of custody starts with this info. The person placing his or her name on this line is responsible for preserving, transporting, and securing the evidence.  
* <b>Date and time</b> - The date and time the evidence was taken into custody
