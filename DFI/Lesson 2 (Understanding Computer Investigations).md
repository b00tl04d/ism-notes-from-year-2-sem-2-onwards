## Taking a Systematic Approach  

Steps for problem solving  
1. Make an initial assessment about the type of case you are investigating - <b>i.e interview people, decide on places to visit and ...etc</b>

6. Identify the risks. <b>i.e unable to access computer due to change of password</b>  
7. Mitigate or minimize the risks <b>to ensure original evidence is always available</b>
8. Test the design <b>like comparing the hash value</b>  
9. <b>Analyse and recover the digital evidence</b>  
10. <b>Investigate the data you recover</b>  
11. <b>Complete the case report</b>  
12. Critique the case <b>Self-evaluation to improve</b>
