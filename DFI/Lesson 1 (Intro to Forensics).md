## Overview of Digital Forensics  

Digital forensics is the  

Application of <b>computer science</b> and <b>investigative procedures</b> for a legal purpose involving the analysis of digital evidence after proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics, use of validated tools, repeatability, reporting, and possible expert presentation  

<br>

The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) was created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings  

FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) was formed in 1984 to handle cases involving digital evidence  

By late 1990s, CART teamed up with Department of Defence Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL)

The <b>Fourth Amendment</b> to the U.S. Constitution protects everyone's right to be secure from search and seizure (The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect people's right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable intrusions by the government)  

Separate <b>search warrants</b> might not be necessary for digital evidence although "Fourth amendment particularly describe ... the things to be seized"  

Investigator is in position to observe the evidence and its incriminating character is apparent
