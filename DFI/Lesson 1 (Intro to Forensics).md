## Overview of Digital Forensics  

Digital forensics is the  

Application of <b>computer science</b> and <b>investigative procedures</b> for a legal purpose involving the analysis of digital evidence after proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics, use of validated tools, repeatability, reporting, and possible expert presentation  

<br>

The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) was created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings  

FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) was formed in 1984 to handle cases involving digital evidence  

By late 1990s, CART teamed up with Department of Defence Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL)  

<br>

The <b>Fourth Amendment</b> to the U.S. Constitution protects everyone's right to be secure from search and seizure (The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect people's right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable intrusions by the government)  

Separate <b>search warrants</b> might not be necessary for digital evidence although "Fourth amendment particularly describe ... the things to be seized"  

Investigator is in position to observe the evidence and its incriminating character is apparent  

<br>


## Case Law  

Existing laws can't keep up with the rate of technological change  

When statues (a written law passed by a legislative body) don't exist, case law is used  
- Allows legal counsel to apply <b>previous similar cases</b> to current one in an effort to address ambiguity in laws  

Examiners must be familiar with recent court rulings on search and seizure in the electronic environment  

<br>


## Developing Digital Forensics Resources  

To <b>supplement</b> your knowledge:  
* Develop and maintain contact with computing, network, and investigative professionals  
* Join computer user groups in both the public and private sectors, for example: <b>Computer Technology Investigators Network (CTIN)</b> meets to discuss problems that digital forensics examiners encounter  
* Consult outside experts  

<br>


## Preparing for Digital Investigations  

Digital investigations fall into 2 categories:  
* Public-sector investigations  
* Private-sector investigations
