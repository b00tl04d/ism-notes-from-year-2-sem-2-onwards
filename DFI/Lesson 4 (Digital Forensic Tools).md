## Evaluating Digital Forensics Tool Needs  

Consider open-source tools; the best value for as many features as possible  

<br>

Questions to ask when evaluating tools  
* On which OS does the forensics tool run  
* What file systems can the tool analyse?  
* Can a scripting language be used with the tool to automate repetitive functions?  
* Does it have automated features?  
* What is the vendor's reputation for providing support?
