## Identifying Digital Evidence  

• Digital evidence  
– Can be any information stored or transmitted in digital form  
– There is a difference between document evidence and digital evidence. i.e document evidence is always visible on its face  

• U.S. courts accept digital evidence as physical evidence  
– Digital data is treated as a tangible object  

• Groups such as the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) set standards for recovering, preserving, and examining digital evidence  

• General tasks investigators perform when working with digital evidence:  
– Identify digital information or artifacts that can be used as evidence  
– Collect, preserve, and document evidence  
– Analyze, identify, and organize evidence  
– Rebuild evidence or repeat a situation to verify that the results can be reproduced reliably  

• Collecting digital devices and processing a criminal or incident scene must be done systematically

## Understanding Rules of Evidence  

• Consistent practices help verify your work and enhance your credibility  
– must handle all evidence consistently  

• Comply with your state’s rules of evidence or with the Federal Rules of Evidence  
– i.e Security and accountability control for evidence  

• Evidence admitted in a criminal case can be used in a civil suit, and vice versa  

• Keep current on the latest rulings and directives on collecting, processing, storing, and admitting digital evidence  

• Digital evidence is unlike other physical evidence because it can be changed more easily  
– The only way to detect these changes is to compare the original data with a duplicate. i.e Hash  

• Most courts have interpreted computer records as hearsay evidence  
– Hearsay is secondhand or indirect evidence  
– Hearsay - Evidence of a statement made other than by a witness  

• Generally, digital records are considered admissible if they qualify as a business record  

• Computer records are usually divided into:  
– Computer-generated records  
• Data maintained by system and not usually data created by human. i.e System logs, proxy log file.  
– Computer-stored records  
• Electronic data that a person creates and saves on a computer, such as a spreadsheet or word processing document.  

• Computer and digitally stored records must be shown to be authentic and trustworthy  
– So that it can be admitted into evidence  

• Computer-generated records are considered authentic if the program that created the output is functioning correctly. I.e. No bugs  
– Usually considered an exception to hearsay rule  

• Collecting evidence according to the proper steps of evidence control helps ensure that the computer evidence is authentic  

• When attorneys challenge digital evidence  
– Often they raise the issue of whether computer-generated records were altered or damaged
