## Identifying Digital Evidence  

• Digital evidence  
– Can be any information stored or transmitted in digital form  
– There is a difference between document evidence and digital evidence. i.e document evidence is always visible on its face  

• U.S. courts accept digital evidence as physical evidence  
– Digital data is treated as a tangible object  

• Groups such as the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) set standards for recovering, preserving, and examining digital evidence  

• General tasks investigators perform when working with digital evidence:  
– Identify digital information or artifacts that can be used as evidence  
– Collect, preserve, and document evidence  
– Analyze, identify, and organize evidence  
– Rebuild evidence or repeat a situation to verify that the results can be reproduced reliably  

• Collecting digital devices and processing a criminal or incident scene must be done systematically

## Understanding Rules of Evidence  

• Consistent practices help verify your work and enhance your credibility  
– must handle all evidence consistently  

• Comply with your state’s rules of evidence or with the Federal Rules of Evidence  
– i.e Security and accountability control for evidence  

• Evidence admitted in a criminal case can be used in a civil suit, and vice versa  

• Keep current on the latest rulings and directives on collecting, processing, storing, and admitting digital evidence  

• Digital evidence is unlike other physical evidence because it can be changed more easily  
– The only way to detect these changes is to compare the original data with a duplicate. i.e Hash  

• Most courts have interpreted computer records as hearsay evidence  
– Hearsay is second hand or indirect evidence  
– Hearsay - Evidence of a statement made other than by a witness  

• Generally, digital records are considered admissible if they qualify as a business record  

• Computer records are usually divided into:  
– Computer-generated records  
• Data maintained by system and not usually data created by human. i.e System logs, proxy log file.  
– Computer-stored records  
• Electronic data that a person creates and saves on a computer, such as a spreadsheet or word processing document.  

• Computer and digitally stored records must be shown to be authentic and trustworthy  
– So that it can be admitted into evidence  

• Computer-generated records are considered authentic if the program that created the output is functioning correctly. I.e. No bugs  
– Usually considered an exception to hearsay rule  

• Collecting evidence according to the proper steps of evidence control helps ensure that the computer evidence is authentic  

• When attorneys challenge digital evidence  
– Often they raise the issue of whether computer-generated records were altered or damaged  

• One test to prove that computer-stored records are authentic is to demonstrate that a specific person created the records  
– The author of a Microsoft Word document can be identified by using file metadata  
• May not be easy as records recovered from slack space or unallocated disk space usually don’t identify the author  

• The process of establishing digital evidence’s trustworthiness originated with written documents and the “best evidence rule”  

• Best evidence rule states:  
– To prove the content of a written document, recording, or photograph, ordinarily the original writing, recording, or photograph is required  
– Allow a duplicate instead of originals when it is produced by the same impression as the original  
• No always possible to produce original  

• As long as bit-stream copies of data are created and maintained properly  
– The copies can be admitted in court, although they aren’t considered best evidence  

• Example of not being able to use original evidence  
– Investigations involving network servers  
• Removing a server from the network to acquire evidence data could cause harm to a business or its owner, who might be an innocent bystander to a crime or civil wrong

## Rules of Evidence  

• The five properties that evidence must have in order to be useful:  
– Admissible  
– Authentic  
– Complete  
– Reliable  
– Believable

## Collecting Evidence in Private-Sector Incident Scenes  

• Typically, businesses have inventory databases of computer hardware and software  
– Understand what h/w and s/w help identify the computer forensics tools needed to analyze a policy violation  
• This is also the best way to conduct the analysis  

• Corporate policy statement about misuse of digital assets  
– Allows corporate investigators to conduct covert surveillance (surveillance on someone without the person notice it) with little or no cause  
– And access company systems without a warrant  

• Companies should display a warning banner and publish a policy  
– Stating that they reserve the right to inspect computing assets at will  

• Corporate investigators should know under what circumstances they can examine an employee’s computer  
– Every organization must have a well-defined process describing when an investigation can be initiated  

• If a corporate investigator finds that an employee is committing or has committed a crime  
• Employer can file a criminal complaint with the police. As investigator, should immediately report to corporate management  

• Employers are usually interested in enforcing company policy  
– Not seeking out and prosecuting employees  

• Corporate investigators are, therefore, primarily concerned with protecting company assets  

• If you discover evidence of a crime during a company policy investigation  
– Determine whether the incident meets the elements of criminal law  
– Inform management of the incident  
– Stop your investigation to make sure you don’t violate Fourth Amendment restrictions on obtaining evidence  
– Work with the corporate attorney on how to respond to a police request for more information

## Processing Law Enforcement Crime Scenes  

• You must be familiar with criminal rules of search and seizure  

• You should also understand how a search warrant works and what to do when you process one  

• Law enforcement officer may search for and seize criminal evidence only with probable cause  
– Probable cause - Reasonable grounds to believe that a particular person has committed a crime, especially to justify making a search or preferring a charge  
– Refers to the standard specifying whether a police officer has the right to make an arrest, conduct a personal or property search, or obtain a warrant for arrest  

• With probable cause, a police officer can obtain a search warrant from a judge  
– That authorizes a search and seizure of specific evidence related to the criminal complaint  

• The Fourth Amendment states that only warrants “particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized” can be issued

## Understanding Concepts and Terms Used in Warrants  

• Innocent information  
– Unrelated information: often included in the information you are looking for. Need to sort all information to obtain what you need. Sometime amount of data can be up to Terabyte!  
– i.e Enron case - by the use of accounting loopholes and poor financial reporting  

• Judges often issue a limiting phrase to the warrant  
– Allows the police to separate innocent information from evidence  
– The warrant must list which items can be seized.  

• Plain view doctrine  
– Objects falling in plain view (what your eyes can see) of an officer who has the right to be in position to have that view are subject to seizure without a warrant and may be introduced in evidence  
– Three criteria must be met:  
• Officer is where he or she has a legal right to be  
• Ordinary senses must not be enhanced by advanced technology in any way  
• Any discovery must be by chance
