## Identifying Digital Evidence  

• Digital evidence  
– Can be any information stored or transmitted in digital form  
– There is a difference between document evidence and digital evidence. i.e document evidence is always visible on its face  

• U.S. courts accept digital evidence as physical evidence  
– Digital data is treated as a tangible object  

• Groups such as the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) set standards for recovering, preserving, and examining digital evidence  

• General tasks investigators perform when working with digital evidence:  
– Identify digital information or artifacts that can be used as evidence  
– Collect, preserve, and document evidence  
– Analyze, identify, and organize evidence  
– Rebuild evidence or repeat a situation to verify that the results can be reproduced reliably  

• Collecting digital devices and processing a criminal or incident scene must be done systematically
