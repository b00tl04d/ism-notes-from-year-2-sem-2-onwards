## Understanding Forensics Lab Certification Requirements  

• Digital forensics lab  
– Where you conduct your investigation  
– Store evidence  
– House your equipment, hardware, and software  

• American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) offers guidelines for:  
– Managing a lab  
– Acquiring an official certification  
– Auditing lab functions and procedures  

<br>

## Identifying Duties of the Lab Manager and Staff  

• Lab Manager duties:  
– Set up processes for managing cases - Processes should be review regularly  
– Promote group consensus in decision making  
– Maintain fiscal responsibility for lab needs \$\$\$  
– Enforce ethical standards among lab staff members  
– Plan updates for the lab  
– Establish and promote quality - assurance processes  
– Ensure that staff know what to do when a case arrive  
– Set reasonable production schedules  
– based on existing resources  
– Estimate how many cases an investigator can handle  
– Certain case can be longer due to the nature of the case  
– Estimate when to expect preliminary and final results  
– Create and monitor lab policies for staff  
– Provide a safe and secure workplace for staff and evidence  

• Staff member duties:  
– Have Knowledge and Training:  
• Hardware and software  
• OS and file types  
• Deductive reasoning  
• Work is reviewed regularly by the lab manager – to ensure that quality of work is maintained  

• Check the ASCLD Web site for online manual and information  

<br>

## Lab Budget Planning  

• Break costs down into daily, quarterly, and annual expenses  
– The better you understand these expenses, the better you can delegate resources for each investigation.  

• Use past investigation expenses to extrapolate (extract) expected future costs – similar to any budget estimation  

• Expenses for a lab include:  
– Hardware  
– Software  
– Facility space  
– Training personnel  

• Estimate the number of computer cases your lab expects to examine  
– Identify types of computers you’re likely to examine  

• Take into account changes in technology – s/w n h/w upgrade  

• Use statistics to determine what kind of computer crimes are more likely to occur – so you can better estimate the resource you need!  

• Use this information to plan ahead your lab requirements and costs  

• When setting up a lab for a private company, check:  
– Hardware and software inventory  
– Problems reported last year  
– Future developments in computing technology  

• Time management (for better resource utilization) is a major issue when choosing software and hardware to purchase  

<br>

## Acquiring Certification and Training  

• Update your skills through appropriate training  
– Thoroughly research the requirements, cost, and acceptability in your area of employment  
– Address the minimum skills for conducting computing investigations at various levels.  

• International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)  
– Created by police officers who wanted to formalize credentials in computing investigations  
– Candidates who complete the IACIS test are designated as a Certified Forensic Computer Examiner (CFCE)  

• AccessData Certified Examiner (ACE) Certification  
– Open to the public and private sectors  
– Is specific to use and mastery of AccessData Ultimate Toolkit  
– The exam has a knowledge base assessment (KBA) and a practical skills assessment (PSA)  

• Other Training and Certifications  
– EC-Council  
– SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute – can be expensive  
– Defense Cyber Investigations Training Academy (DCITA)  

<br>

## Determining the Physical Requirements for a Computer Forensics Lab  

• Most of your investigation is conducted in a lab  

• Lab should be secure so evidence is not lost, corrupted, or destroyed  

• Provide a safe and secure physical environment  

• Keep inventory control of your assets  
– Know what you have and what you don’t have  
– Know when to order more supplies  

<br>

## Identifying Lab Security Needs  

• Secure facility  
– Should preserve integrity of evidence data  

• Minimum requirements  
– Small room with true floor-to-ceiling walls  
– Door access with a locking mechanism  
– Secure container  
– Visitor’s log  

• People working together should have same access level  

• Brief your staff about security policy  

<br>

## Conducting High-Risk Investigations  

• High-risk investigations demand more security than the minimum lab requirements  

– TEMPEST facilities  
• Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) proofed  
– leaking signal can be used to reconstruct information  
• Such facilities can stop information systems from leaking through emanations, including unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations.  

– TEMPEST facilities are very expensive  
• You can use low-emanation workstations instead  

<br>

## Using Evidence Containers  

• Known as evidence lockers  
– Must be secure so that no unauthorized person can easily access your evidence  

• Recommendations for securing storage containers:  
1. Locate them in a restricted area  
2. Limited number of authorized people to access the container  
3. Maintain records on who is authorized to access each container  
4. Containers should remain locked when not in use  

• If a combination locking system is used:  
1. Provide the same level of security for the combination as for the container’s contents – Need to protect the combination!  
2. Destroy any previous combinations after setting up a new combination  
3. Allow only authorized personnel to change lock combinations  
4. Change the combination every six months or when required  

<br>

• If you’re using a keyed padlock:  
1. Appoint a key custodian – Someone responsible for distributing keys  
2. Stamp sequential numbers on each duplicate key  
3. Maintain a registry listing which key is assigned to which authorized person  
4. Conduct a monthly audit  
5. Take an inventory of all keys  
6. Place keys in a lockable container  
7. Maintain the same level of security for keys as for evidence containers  
8. Change locks and keys annually  

• Container should be made of steel with an internal cabinet or external padlock  

• If possible, acquire a media safe  
– Designed to protect electronic media  

• When possible, build an evidence storage room in your lab  

• Keep an evidence log  
– Update it every time an evidence container is opened and closed  

<br>

## Overseeing Facility Maintenance  

• Immediately repair physical damages  

• Escort cleaning crews as they work  
– Is it feasible?  

• Minimize the risk of static electricity  
– Antistatic pads  
– Clean floor and carpets – minimize dust!  

• Maintain two separate trash containers  
– Materials unrelated to an investigation  
– Sensitive materials  

• When possible, hire specialized companies for disposing sensitive materials  

<br>

## Considering Physical Security Needs  

• Enhance security by setting security policies  

• Enforce your policy  
– Maintain a sign-in log for visitors  
• Anyone that is not assigned to the lab is a visitor  
• Escort all visitors all the time  
– Use visible or audible indicators that a visitor is inside your premises  
• Visitor badge  
– Install an intrusion alarm system  
– Hire a guard force for your lab  

<br>

## Auditing a Digital Forensics Lab  

• Auditing ensures proper enforcing of policies  

• Audits should include inspecting the following facility components and practices:  
1. Ceiling, floor, roof, and exterior walls of the lab  
2. Doors and doors locks  
3. Visitor logs  
4. Evidence container logs  
5. At the end of every workday, secure any evidence that’s not being processed in a forensic workstation  

<br>

## Determining Floor Plans for Digital Forensics Labs  

• How you configure the work area will depend on:  
– Your budget  
– Amount of available floor space  
– Number of computers you assign to each computing investigator  

• Ideal configuration is to have:  
– Two forensic workstations – One work station for 2 to 3 cases a month  
– One non-forensic workstation with Internet access  

<br>

## Selecting a Basic Forensic Workstation  

• Depends on budget and needs  

• Use less powerful workstations for mundane tasks  

• Use multipurpose workstations for resource-heavy analysis tasks  

<br>

## Selecting Workstations for a Lab  

• Identify the environment you deal with  
– Hardware platform  
– Operating system – Windows / Mac  

• Police labs have the most diverse needs for computing investigation tools  
– A lab might need legacy systems and software to match what’s used in the community  

• A small, local police department might have one multipurpose forensic workstation and one or two general-purpose workstations  

• You can now use a laptop PC with FireWire, USB 3.0, or SATA hard disks to create a lightweight, mobile forensic workstation  

<br>

## Stocking Hardware Peripherals  

• Any lab should have in stock:  
1. IDE cables  
2. Ribbon cables for floppy disks  
3. Extra USB 3.0 or newer cables and SATA cards  
4. SCSI cards, preferably ultrawide  
5. Graphics cards, both PCI and AGP types  
6. Assorted FireWire and USB adapters  
7. Hard disk drives  
8. At least two 2.5-inch Notebook IDE hard drives to standard IDE/ATA or SATA adapter  
9. Computer hand tools  

<br>

## Maintaining Operating Systems and Software Inventories  

• Maintain licensed copies of software like:  
1. Microsoft Office (current and older version)  
2. Quicken - personal finance management tool  
3. Programming languages (Visual Basic and Visual C++)  
4. Specialized viewers (Quick View- Viewer can be used to view practically any file)  
5. LibreOffice, OpenOffice, or Apache OpenOffice  
6. Peachtree and QuickBooks accounting applications  

<br>

## Summary  

• A digital forensics lab is where you conduct investigations, store evidence, and do most of your work  

• Seek to upgrade your skills through training/certifcation  

• A lab facility must be physically secure so that evidence is not lost, corrupted, or destroyed  

• It is harder to plan a computer forensics lab for a police department than for a private organization or corporation
