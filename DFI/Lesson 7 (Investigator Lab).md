## Understanding Forensics Lab Certification Requirements  

• Digital forensics lab  
– Where you conduct your investigation  
– Store evidence  
– House your equipment, hardware, and software  

• American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) offers guidelines for:  
– Managing a lab  
– Acquiring an official certification  
– Auditing lab functions and procedures  

<br>

## Identifying Duties of the Lab Manager and Staff  

• Lab Manager duties:  
– Set up processes for managing cases - Processes should be review regularly  
– Promote group consensus in decision making  
– Maintain fiscal responsibility for lab needs \$\$\$  
– Enforce ethical standards among lab staff members  
– Plan updates for the lab  
– Establish and promote quality - assurance processes  
– Ensure that staff know what to do when a case arrive  
– Set reasonable production schedules  
– based on existing resources  
– Estimate how many cases an investigator can handle  
– Certain case can be longer due to the nature of the case  
– Estimate when to expect preliminary and final results  
– Create and monitor lab policies for staff  
– Provide a safe and secure workplace for staff and evidence  

• Staff member duties:  
– Have Knowledge and Training:  
• Hardware and software  
• OS and file types  
• Deductive reasoning  
• Work is reviewed regularly by the lab manager – to ensure that quality of work is maintained  

• Check the ASCLD Web site for online manual and information  

<br>

## Lab Budget Planning  

• Break costs down into daily, quarterly, and annual expenses  
– The better you understand these expenses, the better you can delegate resources for each investigation.  

• Use past investigation expenses to extrapolate (extract) expected future costs – similar to any budget estimation  

• Expenses for a lab include:  
– Hardware  
– Software  
– Facility space  
– Training personnel  

• Estimate the number of computer cases your lab expects to examine  
– Identify types of computers you’re likely to examine  

• Take into account changes in technology – s/w n h/w upgrade  

• Use statistics to determine what kind of computer crimes are more likely to occur – so you can better estimate the resource you need!  

• Use this information to plan ahead your lab requirements and costs  

• When setting up a lab for a private company, check:  
– Hardware and software inventory  
– Problems reported last year  
– Future developments in computing technology  

• Time management (for better resource utilization) is a major issue when choosing software and hardware to purchase  

<br>

## Acquiring Certification and Training  

• Update your skills through appropriate training  
– Thoroughly research the requirements, cost, and acceptability in your area of employment  
– Address the minimum skills for conducting computing investigations at various levels.  

• International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)  
– Created by police officers who wanted to formalize credentials in computing investigations  
– Candidates who complete the IACIS test are designated as a Certified Forensic Computer Examiner (CFCE)  

• AccessData Certified Examiner (ACE) Certification  
– Open to the public and private sectors  
– Is specific to use and mastery of AccessData Ultimate Toolkit  
– The exam has a knowledge base assessment (KBA) and a practical skills assessment (PSA)  

• Other Training and Certifications  
– EC-Council  
– SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute – can be expensive  
– Defense Cyber Investigations Training Academy (DCITA)  

<br>

## Determining the Physical Requirements for a Computer Forensics Lab  

• Most of your investigation is conducted in a lab  

• Lab should be secure so evidence is not lost, corrupted, or destroyed  

• Provide a safe and secure physical environment  

• Keep inventory control of your assets  
– Know what you have and what you don’t have  
– Know when to order more supplies  

<br>

## Identifying Lab Security Needs  

• Secure facility  
– Should preserve integrity of evidence data  

• Minimum requirements  
– Small room with true floor-to-ceiling walls  
– Door access with a locking mechanism  
– Secure container  
– Visitor’s log  

• People working together should have same access level  

• Brief your staff about security policy  

<br>

## Conducting High-Risk Investigations  

• High-risk investigations demand more security than the minimum lab requirements
