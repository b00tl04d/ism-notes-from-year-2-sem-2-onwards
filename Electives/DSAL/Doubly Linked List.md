Idea is to implement a data structure that is dynamic at runtime and can easily be modified  

Downside is the slow traversal to find an item within the doubly linked list  

(Node is just an item within the linked list and can be anything)  
Uses a "head" and a "tail" to point to the next and previous nodes in the doubly linked list, instead of just a "head" in a singly linked list that only points to the next node in the list
