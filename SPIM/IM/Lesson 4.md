Security Intelligence as a  
Solution  
• Information integration and correlation  
• Data repository on security information and contextual  
information  
• Largely supported by SIEM products  
• Security profiles on the assets  
• Application, database, network, server  
• Policy engine to examine the asset profiles and  
enforce policies  

Security Intelligence as a  
Solution  
• Emphasis in security programs now shifts from  
detection and blocking technologies to detection  
and response.  
• Security technologies to simultaneously see,  
analyse and take action against attack and  
abnormal activities are highly sought after  
• High interest in security analytics  
• The ability to integrate with external context and  
intelligence feeds is a critical differentiator for next  
generation security platforms
