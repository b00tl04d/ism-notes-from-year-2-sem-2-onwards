Cyber Intelligence
Definition of Threat
Intelligence From an operational perspective (CPNI): "As with traditional
intelligence, a core definition is that threat intelligence is information
that can aid decisions, with the aim of preventing an attack or
decreasing the time taken to discover an attack. Intelligence can
also be information that, instead of aiding specific decisions, helps to
understands the risk landscape."
 Threat intelligence is essential for effective and timely threat detection
and response. You have to assume the bad actors will get through your
preventive network technologies. Threat intelligence is what will enable
you to quickly detect threats and prioritize your response.
Aim of prevention
of attack
, Timely threat
detection
& Response prioritization.
Sliding Scale of Cyber Security
The Sliding Scale of Cyber Security, defines five phases of investments tha
organizations can make to contribute to cyber security program.
Consume Generated Intelligence from Incidents
Intelligence for Security Incident Analysis
 Diamond model can be used in every
stage of the Cyber Kill Chain to
analyse data about an incident.
 Gather Intelligence to provide
attribution (TTP) to threats.
 Enriched context around
event.
 Uses multiple sources for
enrichment.

Threat Intelligence Purpose for SOC & IR
 Support in triaging alerts and events
 Provides enrichment to IOCs and artefacts
 Threat Intelligence Reports
 Threat Intelligence Library / Threat Data Lake of your
environment
 Actionable Intelligence
 Facilitates threat information sharing
 Attributions of cyber attacks
 Implement intelligence findings throughout the organisation
 Through sharing standards
Categories of Intelligence
Threat Intelligence Sources
 Internal Threat Intelligence
 External Threat Intelligence
 Enriched IOCs of Logs, SIEM events
 Commercial Threat Intelligence Service subscription
 Scripts that utilize APIs to extract information from a data
source such as database or website
 Community sharing e.g FS-ISAC
 Open Source Threat Intelligence
How are Intel Feeds Shared ?
 Sharing standards
 STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression)
 a language to describe threat information
 CybOX (Cyber Observable Expression)
 Can be dynamic events or stateful properties that had occurred
e.g domain name, ip address, network traffic
 TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator
Information)
 a transport “vehicle” for STIX information exchanges
 STIX Example

What is a Threat?
Cyber Intelligence Sources
Organisations must know what their threats are to
accurately collect and use threat intelligence
You need to evaluate Adversary’s:
1.Capabilities
2.Hostile Intent
3.Opportunities
Cyber Intelligence Sources
The output of that evaluation is the “intelligence” we are
interested about.
Evidenced-based, deep, rich, contextual intelligence that
includes motivation, intent, targets, attribution and
methods, indicators (threat and technical tags),
implications and actionable advice about an existing or
emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be used to
inform decisions regarding the subject's response to that
menace or hazard. - Gartner 2017

Threat Information
Sources
Challenges
• Raw information harvested from non-English sources
• Accuracy and reliable sources (private,highly sensitive
intelligence often not available for sharing)
• Consumable formats
• Anticipatory content still in infancy (human insight lacking)
Industry-Led Sources
• Industry peers are increasingly focused on disseminating
risk and incident information to allow for a collective
defence against cyber attacks
• A highly connected cyber security ecosystem is desired
across communities – Global tech partners, Tertiary &
research institutes, Venture capitalist & startups, Govt
agencies and enterprises.
• Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC)
eg: Financial Services (FS-ISAC), Information Technology (IT-
ISAC), Automotive (Auto-ISAC).
Industry-Led Sources
ISACs
Known to the public, but are invite-only, and are actively
policed with agreed-on criteria for membership and sharing.
Industry-Led Sources
Conditions:
•Collaboration should preserve the confidentiality of business
and personal data of individuals.
•Through the power of the cloud, various members in the
same industry can share and disseminate data.
•Each member in the community must be able to trust the
others to ensure a free exchange of information.
•For accuracy, the threat and incident information presented
must be verifiable.
Industry-Led Sources
Challenges:
•A competitive environment makes it difficult for the technology
group to get their management and legal teams to agree to share
information.
Solution: ?
Industry-Led Sources
• The below industries have started the process of information
sharing
• Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center
• https://www.fsisac.com/
• Retail Cyber Intelligence Sharing Center

Exercise – identify the
constructs
Consider the following 10 steps in a computer security incident
taking place in a government agency:
1.The logs of the file server show an unusually high amount of activity coming
from one laptop. You start to investigate.
2.A user received an email with the subject “Invoice” and a ZIP attachment. ? The
attachment is a ZIP file with MD5 a0adb2ccf18f65a102c1c975e7e4baec ?. The ZIP
contains an executable with MD5 e4b72ce8ea569b12eabf0aef6ed81615 ?
3.Further investigation shows you that if a file is seen with MD5
e4b72ce8ea569b12eabf0aef6ed81615, it indicates the presence of a crypto
ransomware that was hidden in a ZIP archive ?

4. You report that the laptop from user John Doe was infected at 5:15
p.m. on March 23 with a ransomware XYZ and that the ransomware
was delivered via email (incident).
5. Asking your sharing community returns that the file is ransomware
that gets weaponized by downloading its payload via HTTP from four
C2 servers located in southern Europe (TTP). You receive an IP
watchlist (indicator). You add the list of four C2 servers to a
block/watchlist to detect other infractions (COA). Link the mail
description, the MD5 and the IP watchlist with the incident.
6. You ask the community for more information about the
ransomware’s purpose. You learn that it is known to be the Crypto
Crew using the ransomware family XYZ-A (threat actor). You can
now attribute the incident.
Open standards to share
intelligence
7. The block list reveals there are other infected laptops, all
belonging to human resources users (TTP update, victims).
8. You deploy (COA) blocklists for email attachments with the
same MD5 (indicators) or outgoing HTTP traffic to one of the
C2s (indicators).
9. Other government agencies that applied the same indicators
have hits for email messages arriving for users who are part of
their human resources department. Update the information to
reflect that the ransomware is primarily targeting users in the
human resources departments of government agencies (TTP
update, victims).
10. The sharing community reports a similar case in country ZZ with
the same deployment characteristics (link incident to
campaign).

Get outbound access from proxy with threat intell hits --
Wow - we have a 12k hits, need to narrow down
Get only ones with allowed access - ignore the denied (safe) -- last 10 days
Yikes - we still have 4k hits, have to pull it down
further last 10 daysLet’s look for the ones with file downloads only --
OK - we have 6 hits… good place to start
Let’s check if these were picked by the AV -- lookups 9
