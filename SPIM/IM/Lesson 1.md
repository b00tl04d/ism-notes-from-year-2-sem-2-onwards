## Key Definitions  

Incident (generally a negative event. In the case of IT and cyber security, listed below are a few examples)  
* Unplanned interruption to an IT service  
* Reduction in the quality of an IT service  
* Failure of a CI that has not yet impacted an IT service  

<br>

Service Request (formal request from a user for something to be provided)  
* Request for info or advice; to reset a password; or to install a workstation for a new user  
* NOT a disruption to the agreed service  
* Request Fulfilment process. Manages lifecycle of Service Requests  

<br>

Workaround (Method of bypassing an Incident or Problem, a temporary fix)  
* It is <b>not a permanent solution</b> but something used to get the service up and running till the real solution is found  

<br>


## Incident Lifecycle  

Status codes to indicate where incidents are in relation to their lifecycle/status  

Incident management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all incidents  

5 of them:  

* Open  
* In progress  
* Resolved  
* Closed  
* (Pending)  

<br>


## Purpose and Objectives  

Purpose  
* <b>Restore normal service operations as quickly as possible</b>  
* Minimize the adverse impact on business  
* Ensuring best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained according to SLA's (Service Level Agreements or Terms and Conditions)  

<br>

Objectives  
* Standardized methods and procedures  
* Increased visibility and better communication  
* Priorities aligned with business  
* User satisfaction with the quality of IT services  

<br>


## Value to business  

* Reducing service downtime  
* Reducing Incident impact to business  
* Aligning IT to business priority  
* Identify possible improvements to service  
* Identification of additional requirements (e.g. training, new service) as a result of handling multiple incidents  

<br>

Note: Value of IM is highly visible to the business. For this reason, IM is often one of the first processes to be implemented in Service Management projects  

<br>


## Incident Priority  

* Assigned, to ensure that the support groups will pay the required attention to the incident  
* Based on the Urgency and Impact  

<br>

General formula is...  
Impact + Urgency = Priority  

Impact: How much damage, if not fixed soon?

Urgency: How fast does it need to be fixed  

<br>


## Incident Priority & Timescales  

Must be agreed for all incident-handling stages  

Based upon the overall incident response and resolution targets within SLAs  

Captured as targets within OLAs and Underpinning Contracts (UCs)  

Support groups should be made aware of these timescales  

Service Management tools automate and escalate as required
