## Key Definitions  

Incident (generally a negative event. In the case of IT and cyber security, listed below are a few examples)  
* Unplanned interruption to an IT service  
* Reduction in the quality of an IT service  
* Failure of a CI that has not yet impacted an IT service  

<br>

Service Request (formal request from a user for something to be provided)  
* Request for info or advice; to reset a password; or to install a workstation for a new user  
* NOT a disruption to the agreed service  
* Request Fulfilment process. Manages lifecycle of Service Requests  

<br>

Workaround (Method of bypassing an Incident or Problem, a temporary fix)  
* It is <b>not a permanent solution</b> but something used to get the service up and running till the real solution is found  

<br>


## Incident Lifecycle  

Status codes to indicate where incidents are in relation to their lifecycle/status  

Incident management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all incidents  

5 of them:  

* Open  
* In progress  
* Resolved  
* Closed  
* (Pending)  

<br>


## Purpose and Objectives  

Purpose  
* <b>Restore normal service operations as quickly as possible</b>  
* Minimize the adverse impact on business  
* Ensuring best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained according to SLA's (Service Level Agreements or Terms and Conditions)  

<br>

Objectives  
* Standardized methods and procedures  
* Increased visibility and better communication  
* Priorities aligned with business  
* User satisfaction with the quality of IT services  

<br>


## Value to business  

* Reducing service downtime  
* Reducing Incident impact to business  
* Aligning IT to business priority  
* Identify possible improvements to service  
* Identification of additional requirements (e.g. training, new service) as a result of handling multiple incidents  

<br>

Note: Value of IM is highly visible to the business. For this reason, IM is often one of the first processes to be implemented in Service Management projects  

<br>


## Incident Priority  

* Assigned, to ensure that the support groups will pay the required attention to the incident  
* Based on the Urgency and Impact  

<br>

General formula is...  
Impact + Urgency = Priority  

Impact: How much damage, if not fixed soon?

Urgency: How fast does it need to be fixed  

<br>


## Incident Priority & Timescales  

Must be agreed for all incident-handling stages  

Based upon the overall incident response and resolution targets within SLAs  

Captured as targets within OLAs and Underpinning Contracts (UCs)  

Support groups should be made aware of these timescales  

Service Management tools automate and escalate as required  

<br>

<br>


## Major Incidents  

<b>Major Incident</b> = High Impact + High Urgency  

Highest category of impact for an incident  

Results in significant disruption to the business  

Should have separate procedure  

<br>

<b>A separate procedure (for major incidents)</b>
* Shorter timescales and greater urgency  
* Separate major incident team under the direct leadership of the incident manager  
* Informing Management and Customer  
* Service Desk ensures that all activities are recorded and users are kept fully informed of the progress  

<br>


## Escalations - Hierarchical & Functional  

<b>Escalation</b> is the mechanism that assists timely resolution of an Incident  

<b>Hierarchical Escalation</b> can take place at any moment during resolution  

Possible reasons
* SLA threat  
* Extra resources required  
* Need to inform higher management  

<br>

<b>Functional Escalation</b> means involving more specialist personnel or access privileges to solve the incident. Departmental boundaries may be exceeded

<br>


## Standard Incident models  

Designed and implemented for handling standard (reoccurring) incidents more efficiently  

An Incident Model should including the following:
* Steps required to handle the incident and their order  
* Responsibilities  
* Timescales and thresholds for completion  
* Any escalation procedure  
* Any evidence prevention activities  

<b>Support tools can then be used to automate handling of standard incidents</b>  

<br>

<br>

### Incident Identification  

TRIGGERS: Incidents ... from Event Mgmt, from web interface, from Users, from suppliers, from technical Stuff  

<br>

Incident Identification:  
* Usually it's unacceptable to wait until a user logs an incident  

<br>


## Process Interfaces
